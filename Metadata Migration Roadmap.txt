Metadata Migration Roadmap
Collin Bode, Scott Smith
2018-01-18

What Needs Migration? We have existing, hand crafted first generation metadata in Mongo for UCNRS.  Works with the existing dashboard and API.  

Compatabilities:
	Dashboard Original
	JSON Schema
	API
	Dashboard Multi
	Metadata



Primary migration:  CZO Angelo stations and datastreams - enough to make dashboards work.

Schema and API update: changes to schema will require update to API.  Underlying libraries and platforms need an update as well. 

Things and Thing_Types included?

migration: CZO Angelo metadata updated to new Schema and API

migration: conversion of existing UCNRS stations and datastreams to Loggernet based data.  Unit changes, field name changes.

Incident Reports, Data Flags - import from Sensor Database

Custom Derived Values: 
	manual measurements
	wells
	sampling
