  "description": "The tipping bucket rain gauge at level 2 was clogged by leaf litter.  We removed the leaf litter at ~11:12am with minimal loss of the water.  After removing the leaf litter the water that had accumulated was recorded and thus gave an erroneous rain intensity.  I have no way of knowing when the clog occurred and thus do not know how long the rain intensity data is suspect. Comments:undefined incident report migrated from SensorDB.",
