MIGRATION2 "HAPPY HYBRID"

Purpose:  maintain compatability with round1 Preview Dashboard, while including the first all-Dendra station, Quail Ridge.  

Notes:  
- tools/dendra-push-happyhybrid.sh  will populate all relevant JSON for the Preview Dashboard to operate.  

- Fixes to some existing datastreams are placed into migration2-happyhybrid/datastreams.  These will update after the migration1-preview versions are inserted.
