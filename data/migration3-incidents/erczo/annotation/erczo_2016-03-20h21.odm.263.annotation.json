  "title": "Pole holding wind speed sensor was tilted; fixed",
  "description": "I noticed the vertical pole that holds the wind speed/direction sensor was tilted about 20 degrees off of vertical. I don't know how long the pole was tilted this way. The sensor still appeared to be orienting correctly in the moderate winds that day. I adjusted pole back to vertical by eye (didn't have level) and tightened allen-key-screws.  incident report migrated from SensorDB.",
