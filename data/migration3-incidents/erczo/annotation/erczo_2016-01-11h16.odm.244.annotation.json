  "description": "Rain gage was mis-wired when originally installed.  ground wire was placed in 5v slot on logger.  Hence no precipitation was recorded during this time-period.  All values should be labelled as invalid and excluded.  There is one positive recording at the end the listed time-period, which was a manual test of the gage to confirm it was working.  1 mm in 5 minutes.  ",
