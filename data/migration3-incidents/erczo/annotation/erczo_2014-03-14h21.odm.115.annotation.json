  "description": "At 1340 well 7 had a water depth of 7.720m to the top of the pipe. The old transducer had a cable length of 16.478 to the bottom of the slot in the well pipe.  The old transducer measured 19.2cm long.  At 1350 the pressure transducer was removed from well 7.  At 1413 the transducers  in wells 5, 6 and 7 were disconnected from the data logger (SE 2, 3, 4) The  replacement transducers were connected to the logger (C7) so Collin could modify  the SDI-12 addresses.   The 200' pressure transducer (SN 72010047) that was removed from well 15 was  installed in well 7. It's cable length is 16.334m to the bottom of the slot in the well  pipe. The transducer measures 28.6cm long.  At 1524 well 6 had a water depth of 6.889m. The old transducer cable length was  13.142m to the top of the pipe. A brand new 125' transducer was installed in well 6  (SN 72010046) with a new cable length of 12.958m.  At 1654 well 5 had a water depth of 18.902m. The old transducer cable length was  23.298m. The old transducer had mud on the end of it so I intentionally raised the  placement of the new transducer. The pressure transducer that was removed from  well 16 was installed into well 5. It's SN was covered by putty.  At 1804 all the new transducers were plugged into the data logger. incident report migrated from SensorDB.",
