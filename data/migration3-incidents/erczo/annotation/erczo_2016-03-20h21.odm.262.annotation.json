  "description": "Rain gauge calibration and testing.  There was no natural precipitation during this time period; all rainfall caused was during testing and should be excluded.   We(Jesse Hahm, Chris Wong, Collin Bode) poured a known volume of water from graduated cylinders over 10-15 minute intervals into rain gauges and counted the number of bucket tips (typically audibly).  We initially emptied any extant (leftover from last storm) water, adjusted to level if possible, waited for > 5 minutes (for datalogger cycle), then added 314 mL. Precision of the graduated cylinder was typically better than 3% (estimate).   Pouring water without funnel on resulted in splashed water, water going down wrong bucket, or overflow (uncounted) water; this generally caused a lower than expected number of tips. For this reason, most experiments were done by pouring water into top of rain-gauge with funnel on (closer to natural rainfall).   The results of the experiment:  6 out of 8 of the newer gauges (TB-style, Hydrological Sciences) had less than 5% error from expected.   Two gauges each over-reported by 18% - at Level 2 and 3 at Rivendell. This would lead one to over-estimate rainfall under the canopy and hence under-estimate interception.  All data for the experiments is in CZO/Data/Task1/Rain Gauges in the CZO Google Drive.  The calibration experiments also uncovered a bug in the WSSR station code: The code recorded 0.2mm/tip from the gauge, but the gauge is in fact English 0.01 inch/tip and should record 0.254mm / tip.
