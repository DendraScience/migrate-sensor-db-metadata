  "description": "We had the power off from 11:00am to 3:00pm, so no data was recorded.    We were upgrading southside solar.  We placed brand new 3 Solartec SunXtender batteries in the solar system. We have placed a load center between wells 15 & 16, with thick wires going back to the solar system to reduce line loss. So its ready for isco samplers.  Level 5 data logger is back online. The antenna is now attached to a tree, so hopefully we will not have any more interruptions of data due to a bad radio connection.  Comments:undefined incident report migrated from SensorDB.",
