  "description": "Daniella, Jasper and I visited the site this past weekend. We also found the float on the SF Eel was drastically in error-- and had been so since September.  Collin quickly checked and the third alternate measuring device worked, so no data lost.  We removed remnants of a mouse nest, and reset the float recorder to match the staff plate. Comments:no flags - no data in the database yet incident report migrated from SensorDB.",
