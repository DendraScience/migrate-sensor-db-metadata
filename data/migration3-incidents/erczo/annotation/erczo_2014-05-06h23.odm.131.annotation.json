  "description": "Removed the transducer from the well while the pipe was leveled to make it easier to take neutron probe measurements. The changes to the pipe do no affect the well head height or the depth of the pressure transducers. While sawing the well pipe the blade knicked the transducer cable. The cut went through the rubber cable jacket and exposed the shielding. The cut was wrapped with electrical tape, be careful for noise or bad data incase the cable was compromised.",
